# LLM Zero to Hero Implementation

This is my implementation of the models and experiments demonstrated in Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" video lecture series. The codebase follows the original pedagogical progression, focusing on the fundamental principles of Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning. I wrote this for my own learning purposes. I have only used python files instead of jupyter notebooks. If you are someone who likes python files more than jupyter notebooks, please feel free to fork and use it in your learning process.
